## 📂 Phase 1 Highlights: Foundations
*Completed January 2026*

In this phase, I focused on "Syntax De-rusting" and building robust logic gates. Key projects include:
* Interactive Tooling: A multi-input calculator using *args for scalable math operations.
* Security & Control Flow: A secure login system with attempt-limiting logic.
* String Analysis: An alphanumeric palindrome detector and a password strength evaluator.
* Data Collections: A CRUD-based (Create, Read, Update, Delete) shopping list manager.
